## About Me

Mazursky Alexander a.k.a Cringe Lord (Embarassment Seignour formally) has been treating his surroundings to top-tier second-rate funny pictures for 21 years, and has now descended to creating websites and posting dubious content with zero reach. His contribution to the global cringe-content industry cannot be overstated—millions of pixels have suffered in the name of his artistic vision, while social media algorithms silently turned away, unwilling to have anything to do with it.

In rare moments of clarity, he ponders the meaning of his creative work, only to be quickly distracted by yet another meme from 2014, which he is convinced "will definitely land." Between blog posts read only by himself and search engine bots, and endless HTML edits that go unnoticed by everyone but him, he finds solace in the thought that someday his genius will be recognized... Or at least accidentally appear in someone's feed.
